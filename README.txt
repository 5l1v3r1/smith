Architecture
------------

A lightweight, protocol-independent server that responds on all configured
ports with configurable protocol responses.

Minimal Viable Product Requirements:
    Respond to an HTTP request with a static HTTP response on all configured ports.

Stretch Goals
    Add support for the RTP protocol so as to test UDP.
